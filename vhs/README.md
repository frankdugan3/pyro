# Pyro VHS

These are demos of Pyro's functionality, via [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs).

There is a script `generate-vhs.sh` that will generate all of them in parallel.

It is best practice to create matching `.ex` file for the demo, else the tapefile could become decoupled from the code of the file as needs change.
